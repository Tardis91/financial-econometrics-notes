# Quantitative Research Projects

Welcome to my collection of quantitative research projects in **financial econometrics**, **machine learning**, and **data-driven investment strategies**. This site serves as both a personal reference and a public portfolio of the concepts, models, and tools I'm exploring.

## ðŸ“Š Projects

### [Stationarity & Unit Root Testing](/stationarity)
Investigating how to test for stationarity in time series data using ADF and KPSS, and why it matters for model reliability.

### [ACF and PACF Plots](acf-pacf.md)
Visual and statistical analysis of autocorrelation patterns to guide ARMA/GARCH model selection.

### [ARMA Models](arma.md)
Building and interpreting ARMA models using `statsmodels`, with applications to equity returns.

### [GARCH Models for Volatility Forecasting](garch.md)
Using GARCH and its extensions to model and forecast market volatility.

### [Cointegration & Error Correction Models](cointegration.md)
Testing for long-run equilibrium relationships between assets â€” essential for pairs trading and macro analysis.

## ðŸ§  Ongoing Work

- Feature selection using information criteria
- Machine learning vs. classical time series forecasting
- High-frequency data smoothing techniques
- Macroeconomic variable modeling

## ðŸ§¾ About

This project is part of my ongoing development as a quant researcher. I'm combining theory from econometrics with hands-on Python tools to build real-world models and frameworks.
